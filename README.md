Blaster Bots is a third-person, survival-style action shooter where players control a heroic robot fighting to restore order after a system-wide corruption outbreak. Set on the mechanical world of Cylindra, millions of service robots have gone rogue after a mysterious virus infected the planet’s core network. The player, known as Unit B-08, also known as Bob, must defend the last stable sector by disabling corrupted robots using a Photon Blaster — an energy weapon that neutralizes targets and cleanses the virus without destruction. Bob must survive five increasingly difficult waves of rogue machines to restore peace to his planet.
